#42

Fillit is the second project required to complete here at 42, welcome to the ultimate fuckery.

Its a tetris wannabe, that looks for hash marks that replicate "tetriminos"  and are supposed to be connected and put on the board i guess?

 its a 4x4 array and back tracking algo and functions to analyze its location and values..
 
 Forgive me if im wrong.
