#42

Fillit is the second project required to complete here at 42, welcome to the ultimate fuckery

Ok, so the "tetris" field is 5 x 5, and the pieces are located on a 4 x 4 field with and extra line under it to seperate them (i believe), extract_tetrimino is the first function to execute, it starts by reading the file and putting the info in a new container of space, that it returns at the end in a format that is called t_tet, after it has retrieved info, it will check the location of each piece and replace them with a letter that come as/after 'A', The backtracking algo is all that happens after that, then fillit function then free the ptrs then done. (i guess)
 
 Forgive me if im wrong.
